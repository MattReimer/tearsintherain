# Tears in the Rain

Life is short. How short? VERY SHORT! Here's a tool that will hopefully make you realize it.


### About

#### What IS this?!?

It's a quick and dirty estimation of how many days you have left on earth to do... whatever it is you're going to do.

#### What's with the name?

Look it up. If you don't know then I'm excited for what you're about to find out.

#### Sorcery! How could you posibly know this?!?

A guess is made, based on [life expectancy tables kept by the US Social Security website](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#fn2) (US only for now, sorry).

Then we take 10 years off if you're a smoker.

#### That's not very accurate.

You're not very accurate! It's not meant to be accurate. Just poignant. Nobody will ever know when you're going to die except you and by the time you figure it out it will be too late to update this site.

#### This is depressing! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!?

Life is so painfully, tragically short and we're terrible at realizing it. This tool is here to help you not waste any more time.

#### Do you collect my data?

Nope. It only remembers because it stores a cookie on your computer. We don't collect anything except google analytics.

### Shout out

There are a bunch of deathclocks out there. The one that inspired me was [this one](https://github.com/kevinhnguyen/deathFocus) by [kevinhnguyen](https://github.com/kevinhnguyen)

All the data comes from the [US Social Security](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#fn2).

This app was easier to write because of the following libraries:

* [jquery-cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie)
* [birthday-picker](https://github.com/abecoffman/birthdaypicker)
* [moment](http://momentjs.com/)
* [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)
* [ionicons](http://ionicons.com/)
* [CSS: Water Drop Effect](http://abduzeedo.com/water-drop-effect-html-css)
